# hello-quantum-world

Hi! Welcome to the QOSI Quantum Algorithms repo.

While this is a part of an initiative for open source projects, this project will initially focus more on learning Q#, basic quantum computing concepts and a few quantum algorithms. We will do this primarily using Microsoft's Quantum Katas.

Once we are comfortable with the language, we will move on to the main project- building the CHSH game. While the Katas already have a tutorial for this, we will try to build this on our own, with a few additions. Our aim is to demonstrate that a quantum strategy is better than a classical one in this particular game.

Pre-requisites:
1. Linear algebra
2. Complex numbers

It's okay if you aren't very well versed in these topics, we will only need the basics, and we'll brush up on those too.
